This app allows you to enter the movements (entry/exit) by hooking them to a bank, which we have previously entered.

It is possible to view all the transactions relating to a bank or filter them on the basis of two start and end dates.

For a movement we can change the two dates, entry/exit, the amount and type of movement, entry/exit, and the related note but we cannot change the bank to which it is linked.

We can also cancel a movement.

Reports on any bugs are welcome, which will be immediately corrected and a new version published, or a request to add new features, which will be included in a future version.
